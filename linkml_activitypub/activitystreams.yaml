  # Core Types

  Object:
    description: Describes an object of any kind. The Object type serves as the base type for most of the other kinds of objects defined in the Activity Vocabulary, including other Core types such as Activity, IntransitiveActivity, Collection and OrderedCollection.

  Link:
    description: A Link is an indirect, qualified reference to a resource identified by a URL. The fundamental model for links is established by [ RFC5988]. Many of the properties defined by the Activity Vocabulary allow values that are either instances of Object or Link. When a Link is used, it establishes a qualified relation connecting the subject (the containing object) to the resource identified by the href. Properties of the Link are properties of the reference as opposed to properties of the resource.

  Activity:
    description: An Activity is a subtype of Object that describes some form of action that may happen, is currently happening, or has already happened. The Activity type itself serves as an abstract base type for all types of activities. It is important to note that the Activity type itself does not carry any specific semantics about the kind of action being taken.

In most cases, the object will be an Activity describing some previously performed action (for instance, a person may have previously "liked" an article but, for whatever reason, might choose to undo that like at some later point in time). The target and origin typically have no defined meaning.
    is_a: Activity
    class_uri: as:Undo

  Update:
    description:  Indicates that the actor has updated the object. Note, however, that this vocabulary does not define a mechanism for describing the actual set of modifications made to object. The target and origin typically have no defined meaning.
